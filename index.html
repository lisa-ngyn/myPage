                    human-computer-interaction. Honestly, before
                    that I didn't really know anything about
                    coding, user experience or technologies in
                    general. Over the past few semesters I got to
                    discover the fun behind designing interfaces,
                    analysing the user's needs as well as bringing
                    all of your thoughts to life using code.</a>

                    experienced so much differently, depending
                    on where you grew up. I think the beauty in the
                    world really lies within the diversity and
                    individuality each culture has to offer. I

                    human body, which is why I think it is so important
                    to take care of it. I know the insecurity,
                    frustration and shame associated with skin
                    irritations, hence I enjoy educating myself

                        <p class="project-text" id="text-portfolio">Before participating in Dr. Angela Yu's bootcamp for web development, I specialised
                        in User Experience Design and User Research. I took various courses in university,
                        which stressed the importance of user centered design.
                        Because I wanted to improve my skills in UX / UI design, I focused on three projects,
                        which you can find in my <a href="https://lisanguyen.crevado.com" target="_blank" style="color:#FF6666; text-decoration: none">UX portfolio</a>.
                        By doing projects like these, I was able to learn so much and gain some valueable
                        hands-on experience.
                        One project is about the design of a website for a restaurant. I made a
                        desktop version as well as a mobile version for this.
                        Another project includes a journaling app, where I conceptualised as well as designed
                        the app.
                        All of those prototypes were created using Figma.

                            <p class="project-text" id="text-agency"> As I already mentioned, I started doing an online course on web development a few weeks.
                                ago. The course included many different projects, one being the development of a website
                                for a <a href="https://lisa-ngyn.github.io/html-agency/" target="_blank" style="color:#FF6666; text-decoration: none">
                                design agency.</a>
                                This was a fictious project, so no real agencies whatsoever were involved. Nevertheless,
                                this was a great way in order to practise my coding skills.
                                It's a pretty simple website, as
                                this was one of the earlier projects we completed for the bootcamp. The first few
                                sections of the bootcamp had a special focus on HTML and CSS.
                                The goal here was particularly to learn about the alignment of elements as well as a
                                website's responsiveness.
                                I achieved the positioning of each element by using flexbox and floats. Media queries
                                helped me to create the responsiveness of the website, making it accessible for various
                                different screen sizes.

                            <h3>Moving Company</h3>
                            <p class="project-text" id="text-moving">
                                Another project of the bootcamp involved the development of a website for a <a href="https://lisa-ngyn.github.io/moving/" target="_blank" style="color:#FF6666; text-decoration: none">moving
                                company</a>. This website is a little bit more asthetically pleasing as well as complex
                                than the prior website of the design agency.

                                In this project, I learned how to use bootstrap in order to quickly create a beautiful
                                and responsive website - making it accessible to multiple different screen sizes.
                                Honestly, I was a little bit surprised, how effortlessly and fast all of that can be done
                                if you use frameworks like these.
                                Using bootstrap, I was able to create a professional looking website, containing a carousel,
                                a search bar, a navigation bar, buttons and so much more so easily.
                                As pleasent it might be 
                                to look at, this website has no functionality yet, as this
                                - again - was one of the earlier
                                projects, where we focused on HTML and CSS.
                                Using bootstrap for this project was incredibly fun!

                            <p class="project-text" id="text-dice">
                                Following the initial exploration of HTML and CSS in the first few section of the bootcamp,
                                our studies progressed to delve into the realm of JavaScript. We learned basic concepts like
                                variables, if-statements, loops and so on. Thankfully, as I had already learned quite a bit
                                of Java in university, I was already familiar with those typical programming concepts. Our
                                first project using JavaScript was a simple <a href="https://lisa-ngyn.github.io/dice-game/" target="_blank" style="color:#FF6666; text-decoration: none">dice game</a>: As the user refreshes the page,
                                two dice are thrown. The user with the higher score wins. To be fair, although the HTML and 
                                CSS code is pretty simple, I did not write it myself. Those files were provided in the
                                assignment, as Angela Yu wanted us to concentrate solely on JavaScript.
                                For this project, I simply used Math.random() to generate random numbers for the dice.

                            <p class="project-text" id="text-dice">
                                After implementing our first little project (dice game) using JavaScript, we continued learning
                                more about it. For the next section, we dived a bit deeper into JavaScript and developed a <a href="https://lisa-ngyn.github.io/drum-kit/" target="_blank" style="color:#FF6666; text-decoration: none">drum kit.</a>
                                It's a website which allows you to produce drum sounds by either clicking buttons or pressing keys
                                (w, a, s, d, j, k, l). Each of the buttons and keys correspond to different sounds.
                                This assignment - again - provided most of the HTML as well as CSS code, because Angela wanted us
                                to fully focus on writing JavaScript.

                                In order to play different sounds depending on the user interaction (either clicking a particular button
                                or pressing a particular key), I used the Document Object Model (DOM), EventListeners and
                                switch-statements. 
                                <!-- I simply used Math.random() to generate random numbers between 0 and 0.9999.
                                Using some mathematical operations, I turned those numbers to numbers between 1 and 6. These 
                                numbers were then used to "throw" the dice and determining the winner. -->

                                This was a fictious project, so no real agencies whatsoever were involved. Nevertheless,
                                this was a great way in order to practise my coding skills.
                                It's a pretty simple website, as
                                this was one of the earlier projects we completed for the bootcamp. The first few
                                sections of the bootcamp had a special focus on HTML and CSS.
                                The goal here was particularly to learn about the alignment of elements as well as a
                                website's responsiveness. <br/>
                                I achieved the positioning of each element by using flexbox and floats. Media queries
                                helped me to create the responsiveness of the website, making it accessible for various
                                different screen sizes.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <div class="project moving">
                        <div class="project-photo" id="photo-moving">
                            <a href="https://lisa-ngyn.github.io/moving/" target="_blank"><img src="./images/moving-firm-photo.png" alt="photo of moving firm" width="100%"></a>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Moving Company</h3>
                            <p class="project-text" id="text-moving">
                                Another project of the bootcamp involved the development of a website for a <a href="https://lisa-ngyn.github.io/moving/" target="_blank" style="color:#FF6666; text-decoration: none">moving
                                company</a>. This website is a little bit more asthetically pleasing as well as complex
                                than the prior website of the design agency.

                                In this project, I learned how to use bootstrap in order to quickly create a beautiful
                                and responsive website - making it accessible to multiple different screen sizes. <br/>
                                Honestly, I was a little bit surprised, how effortlessly and fast all of that can be done
                                if you use frameworks like these.
                                Using bootstrap, I was able to create a professional looking website, containing a carousel,
                                a search bar, a navigation bar, buttons and so much more so easily.
                                As pleasent it might be
                                to look at, this website has no functionality yet, as this - again - was one of the earlier
                                projects, where we focused on HTML and CSS.
                                Using bootstrap for this project was incredibly fun!
